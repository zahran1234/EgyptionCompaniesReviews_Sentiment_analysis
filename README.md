# EgyptionCompaniesReviews_Sentiment_analysis


# steps of the project 
## dataset 
     collected from  Twitter and google play about Egyptian companies 
## Data cleaning 
```
     1-headline emojis 
     2-remove_diacritics
     3-remove stop words
```

## Convert text data to numerical data 
```
     1- TF-IDF 
     2 - word2vec use average word2vec (features extraction )
```
# models
## Traditional machine-learning models
```
           1-SVM
           2-decision tree
           3-random forest
           4-KNN
           5-NB 
           6-LSVM
```
## Deep learning models 
           ```
           1-forward neural network 
           2-convolution neural network       
           
           ```
## Sequential models 
```
1-RNN
2-GRU
3-LSTM

```
## best results 
```
apply average word2vec for text representation
use GRU

```
